# SimpleLongJSON

This is extended version of SimpleJSON library published at: http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/SimpleJSON

This is intended to be used in Unity 3D.
This library contains added Long support. 
It was done to enable receiving JSON data which contains long numbers (like Facebook ID's). 
The original SimpleJSON screws the number, by returning it as int32 (when it should be int64/long).
